In this code, we will learn how to create a link within page in html code

the basic structure of creating link is,

	<a href="link_address"> "any text" </a>

 -->

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

	<h1> Programming Introduction </h1>

		<p>
			In this tutorial, we will learn about programming.

			<br> <!-- This is a line break statement -->

			<h2>So, what is programming actually?</h2> 
			Programming is the way to teach the dummy computer what to do becasue
			a computer only understands 1's and 0's nothing else.

				In this chapter we will learn about C programming language.
				So,
				<h2> What is C programming language actually? </h2>
				C programming is a general purpose programming language, supporting structural programming and recursion.

				<br>
				<br>
				In 1972 Dennis Ritchie first introduced C programming language to the world.

				<br>
				<br>
				Yeah,you can say it's too old.Despite being too old C is highly efficient and cross Platform supported.
				<br>
				For this reason, it is widely used in application development and for fields like system programming, socket programming, C is the first choice of programmers.

				In this chapter we will learn about C++ programming Language.
				So,
				<h2> What is C++ programming language actually? </h2>
				C++ programming is a general purpose programming language, it has imperative, object-oriented and  generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low memory manipulation.

				<br>
				<br>
				In 1979 C++ programming language first come with name "C with classes" because it was the object oriented version of C.
				<br>
				In 1983 "C with classes" renamed with "C++"(++ being the increment operator of C).
				<br>
				In 1985, the first version of C++ Programming language was released.
				<br> 
				Creator of C++ language is "Bjarne Stroustrup"
				<br>
				<br>
				It was desined with bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrainted and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as it's design highlights.
				<br>
				In simpler words, C++ was created for making System Programming easier.
