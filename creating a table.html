In this code, we will learn how to enter spaces between words or letters in html code

consider this two words: one, zero

for single spacing we can simply write: one zero

but for multple spacing we need to use keyword: &nbsp
			
			&nbsp = one_space

	that's why, one zero and one&nbspzero is same

	for three spaces we can either use,
									one&nbsp&nbsp&nbspzero

									or

									one &nbsp zero

	
		in  the second example there is one space before and after the &nbsp

		so, 2(spaces) + 1 (&nbsp) = 3 spaces between one and zero
