<this is a html comment>

In this html code we will learn about div (divisions) and spans in html codes

here divisions means grouping, we all see that in advanced programming in form of function, method or module

here we use div to group html page contents for better understanding and it is useful for creating css classes for special effects on 
html code

for creating a division you just have to use following tags,

                                                       <div> </div>
        
        inside  this tags you can implement the html contents, also you can create another division inside a division


Now, what is spans?

If you want to specify couple of words for special css effect then you can use following tags,

                                                                <span>   </span>
